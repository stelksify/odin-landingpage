# Odin Landing Page

This is the final project for the CSS foundations section in The Odin Project curriculum. 

The goal of this project is to create a web page from scratch following a design provided. This will be entirely possible based on the skills that we have learned so far, with a few more skills that are easily searchable.

The project need not be pixel-perfect, but it should be relatively close.

By the end of this project, I am expected to be able to show my skills with CSS, particularly using flex and how to use its different properties in order to achieve the desired layout.
